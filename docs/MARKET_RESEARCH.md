# Australian Strata Management Software Market Research
**Compiled:** 15 February 2026  
**Prepared for:** Stratus Consulting Group - Chris Johnstone  
**Purpose:** Market analysis for affordable strata management MVP targeting small operators

---

## Executive Summary

The Australian strata management software market is dominated by enterprise-grade platforms (StrataMax, MRI Strata Master, Urbanise) that price themselves beyond the reach of small operators managing fewer than 50 lots. With 368,234 strata schemes nationally and 67% having just 1-5 lots (92% having ≤20 lots), there's a significant underserved market segment currently relying on spreadsheets or avoiding professional management altogether.

**Key Opportunity:** 240,000+ small schemes (1-20 lots) represent a $2.4-12M ARR opportunity at $10-50/lot/year pricing.

## Market Size & Structure

### National Statistics (2024)
Source: Australasian Strata Insights Report 2024 (UNSW City Futures Research Centre + SCA)

- **Total strata schemes:** 368,234 (up 3% from 2022)
- **Total lots:** 3,191,244 (up 5% from 2022)
- **People living in strata:** 4.2 million (15% of Australian population)
- **Insured value:** $1.4 trillion (up from $1.3T in 2022)
- **Annual levies collected:** $10 billion (up from $8.5B in 2022)
- **Growth rate:** Adding 240,000+ new lots every two years

### Scheme Size Distribution (Critical for Targeting)

| Scheme Size | % of Schemes | % of Total Lots | Target Market |
|-------------|--------------|-----------------|---------------|
| 1-5 lots | 67% | ~20% | ✅ **Primary target** |
| 6-20 lots | 25% | ~25% | ✅ **Secondary target** |
| 21-50 lots | 5% | ~20% | ⚠️ Transition zone |
| 51-100 lots | 2% | ~15% | ❌ Enterprise territory |
| 100+ lots | 1% | ~20% | ❌ Enterprise only |

**Key Insight:** 92% of schemes have ≤20 lots but represent only 45% of total lots. Enterprise platforms focus on the 8% of large schemes because they contain 55% of lots = higher per-client revenue. **This leaves the small operator market massively underserved.**

### State Breakdown

| State/Territory | Schemes | Lots | Insured Value | Notes |
|-----------------|---------|------|---------------|-------|
| **NSW** | 91,346 | 1,070,000+ | $486 billion | 17% of population in strata; first state to exceed 1M lots |
| **Victoria** | 128,896 | 950,000+ | $471 billion | Highest number of schemes; 9% lot growth 2022-24 |
| **Queensland** | ~75,000 | 650,000+ | $245 billion | Strong growth in SEQ region |
| **WA** | ~35,000 | 200,000+ | $112 billion | 10% of WA population in strata |
| **ACT** | ~8,000 | 95,000+ | N/A | Highest growth rate (19% increase in lots 2020-22) |
| **SA/TAS/NT** | ~30,000 | 226,000+ | N/A | Smaller markets |

**WA-Specific Opportunity:** ~35,000 schemes × 67% small = ~23,400 small schemes in WA alone. At 8 lots average = 187,200 lots. At $6/lot/month = **$1.12M/month WA market potential** for small operator segment.

### Employment & Management Companies

- **Full-time strata managers:** 2,796 nationally (at SCA member companies)
- **Other staff:** 3,656 (administrative, support roles)
- **SCA member companies manage:** ~60% of all Australian lots (~1.9M lots)
- **Non-SCA / small operators:** Manage remaining ~40% (~1.27M lots)

**Key Finding:** If SCA member companies (established, well-resourced firms) manage 60% of lots, they're likely managing 80-90% of large schemes and only 30-40% of small schemes. This means **hundreds of small operators** and **thousands of self-managed schemes** are underserved.

### Market Gaps Identified

| Customer Segment | Current Solution | Pain Points | Opportunity |
|------------------|------------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Small agencies (<50 lots)** | Spreadsheets, Strack (maybe), nothing | Can't afford $5K-15K+/year enterprise fees; too small for Intellistrata's 600-lot minimum | ✅ **Primary target** |
| **Real estate agents dabbling in strata** | Excel, Word, Gmail | No strata-specific features; compliance risk; time-consuming | ✅ **High potential** |
| **Self-managed small schemes (1-10 lots)** | Committee treasurer with Excel | No professional tools; levy collection manual; poor record-keeping | ✅ **Future expansion** |
| **Sole practitioner strata managers** | Generic property software or spreadsheets | Compliance gaps; no trust accounting; inefficient | ✅ **Key persona** |

**Pricing Gap Analysis:**
- **Enterprise tier:** Estimated $5,000-$20,000+/year (varies by portfolio size)
- **Intellistrata minimum:** $6,000/year (600 lots × $10)
- **Market gap:** No credible offering for operators managing 20-500 lots
- **Our opportunity:** $500-$5,000/year pricing band (50× gap)

## Pricing Landscape

### Competitor Pricing (Confirmed)

| Provider | Model | Price Range | Minimum Entry | Transparency | Target Customer |
|----------|-------|-------------|---------------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Intellistrata** | Per-lot/year | $10-55/lot/year | 600 lots = $6K/year | ✅ Published | Agencies 600+ lots |
| **Urbanise** | Per-lot | Not disclosed | Quote required | ❌ Sales-only | Mid-large agencies |
| **StrataMax** | Per-scheme (est.) | Not disclosed | Implementation project | ❌ Sales-only | Enterprise |
| **MRI Strata Master** | Per-scheme (est.) | Not disclosed | Quote required | ❌ Sales-only | Mid-large agencies |
| **PropertyIQ** | Subscription | Not disclosed | Quote required | ❌ Sales-only | Professional managers |
| **MYBOS** | Varies | Not disclosed | No free trial | ❌ Sales-only | Building managers |
| **Strack** | Not disclosed | "Cost-effective" | Not disclosed | ❌ Sales-only | Small-mid agencies |

### Industry Pricing Estimates (Based on Market Research & Testimonials)

- **Enterprise platforms (StrataMax, MRI):** $50-150/scheme/month or $15-50K+/year for mid-size portfolios
- **Mid-tier platforms:** $20-80/scheme/month
- **Per-lot pricing:** Typically $0.80-$4.50/lot/month ($10-55/lot/year confirmed for Intellistrata)
- **Hidden costs:** Implementation fees ($2K-$10K+), training, data migration, per-user licensing

### Pricing Barrier Analysis

**Example: Small WA operator managing 12 schemes (averaging 6 lots each = 72 lots total)**

| Platform | Annual Cost | Affordable? | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------------|-------|
| Intellistrata | $6,000 (min 600 lots) | ❌ 8.3× too expensive | Below minimum threshold |
| Urbanise (est. $2/lot/mo) | $1,728/year | ❌ Maybe | Still significant; quote uncertainty |
| Enterprise (est. $40/scheme/mo) | $5,760/year | ❌ No | 80% of revenue at $6K total mgmt fees |
| **Spreadsheets** | $0 | ✅ Yes | Current default for this segment |

**Strategic Pricing Insight:** Small operators managing 50-150 lots can't justify $3K-$6K+/year software costs when their total annual management fee revenue is often $10K-$30K. **They need a <$1,000-$2,500/year solution to achieve reasonable ROI.**

## Pain Points: Small Operators & Real Estate Agents

### Research Sources
- Industry articles (PMVA, OnSilent, Strata Community Association)
- Competitor positioning analysis (what they DON'T serve)
- Market gap analysis (what 92% of schemes need vs. what's available)

### **Top Pain Points**

1. **Enterprise Pricing Excludes Them**
   - Can't afford $5K-$20K/year platforms
   - Quote-based pricing creates uncertainty
   - Implementation fees add $2K-$10K upfront
   - ROI impossible with small portfolios

2. **Feature Bloat / Complexity**
   - Enterprise platforms built for 100+ scheme portfolios
   - Complex workflows designed for large teams
   - Features they'll never use (multi-office, advanced analytics, etc.)
   - Steep learning curve

3. **Minimum Lot/Scheme Requirements**
   - Intellistrata: 600-lot minimum = excludes true small operators
   - Others: Unclear minimums but sales processes favour larger clients

4. **Manual Administration Overhead**
   - Spreadsheet hell: levy tracking, owner databases, document filing
   - Email overload: No centralised owner communication
   - Compliance risk: Missing meeting deadlines, poor record retention
   - Time sink: 10-15 hours/week on admin (per MRI testimonial of time SAVED)

5. **Spreadsheet Limitations**
   - No trust accounting integration
   - Manual levy notices and arrears tracking
   - Poor document management (Word/PDF scattered across folders)
   - No owner portal (constant phone calls and emails)
   - Compliance gaps (7-year record retention, audit trails)

6. **Trust Accounting Compliance Risk**
   - WA requires trust accounts (ADI separate/pooled/own)
   - Manual reconciliation error-prone
   - Audit trail requirements
   - State penalties for non-compliance

7. **Limited Support for Self-Managed Schemes**
   - Small schemes (2-10 lots) often self-managed
   - Committee treasurers struggle with Excel levy tracking
   - No professional tools at accessible price points
   - Opportunities for software-as-a-service to committees

8. **Real Estate Agent Challenges**
   - Agents dabbling in strata management (supplementary income)
   - Use property management software (not strata-specific)
   - Compliance gaps (trust accounting different for strata vs. rentals)
   - Time-consuming manual work reduces profitability

### **What They're Using Today**

| Solution | % of Small Operators (est.) | Limitations |
|----------|---------------------------|-------------|
| Excel + Word + Gmail | 40-50% | No trust accounting, compliance risk, time-intensive |
| Generic property mgmt software | 20-30% | Not strata-specific, missing key features (levies, AGM, by-laws) |
| Strack or low-end platforms | 10-15% | Limited feature sets, often still too expensive |
| Paper-based systems | 5-10% | Extremely high risk, no scalability |
| Nothing (ad-hoc) | 10-15% | Self-managed schemes, severe compliance risk |

### **Key Insight: The "Good Enough" Problem**

Small operators tolerate spreadsheet pain because:
- They can't afford enterprise platforms
- No credible affordable alternative exists
- Switching costs (time, learning curve, data migration) seem high
- **They don't know what they're missing** (automation, compliance, owner portals)

**Our MVP must demonstrate ROI in <3 months** via time savings + compliance risk reduction to overcome inertia.

## Key Takeaways for MVP Strategy

1. **The market is massive but fragmented:** 338,000+ small schemes, 500-1,000 small operators, mostly underserved.

2. **Pricing is the #1 barrier:** Existing solutions cost $5K-$20K+/year. **$6/lot/month ($72/lot/year) is the sweet spot** to undercut by 50-80%.

3. **600-lot minimum gap:** Intellistrata's requirement creates a massive opportunity for operators managing 10-500 lots.

4. **Spreadsheet inertia is real:** Must demonstrate ROI through time savings (10+ hours/week) + compliance risk reduction.

5. **WA is ideal launch market:** 32,000+ small schemes, Chris's local network (Donna Henneberry, local real estate contacts), strong understanding of WA Strata Titles Act.

6. **MVP must nail compliance:** Trust accounting, levy automation, meeting records, 7-year document retention = non-negotiable.

7. **Self-serve onboarding wins:** No sales calls, no implementation projects, operational in <1 week.

8. **Freemium could be powerful:** Free tier for self-managed schemes (≤10 lots) = 338,000 potential users, many will professionalise or recommend to managers.

---

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Validate with Donna Henneberry** - Get feedback on pricing, features, pain points from WA perspective
2. **Interview 5-10 small operators** - Understand current workflows, willingness to pay, feature priorities
3. **Build pricing calculator** - Show ROI: time saved × hourly rate vs. software cost
4. **Regulatory review** - Consult WA strata lawyer on trust accounting requirements
5. **Competitive trial** - Sign up for Intellistrata/Strack trials to understand UX and gaps
