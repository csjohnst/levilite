## ⚠️ Names to Avoid

### Trademark/Brand Conflicts
- **Stratify** - Too close to existing "Stratafy" (stratafyconnect.com, active strata building management software)
- **StrataFlow** - Domain taken (strataflow.com.au registered), likely in use
- **StrataMax** - Existing competitor
- **MyBlok** - Domain taken (myblok.com.au registered)
- **OurLot** - Domain taken (ourlot.com.au registered)

### Generic/Weak Names
- **StrataEasy** - Too similar to existing patterns, taken domain
- **EasyStrata** - Clunky word order, generic
- **StrataSimply** - Grammatically awkward (adverb suffix)

### Relevance Issues
- **Blokly** - While available and modern, "blok" doesn't clearly communicate strata/property management
- **Lotify** - The "-ify" suffix is trendy but doesn't add clear meaning to "lot"

## 🎯 Strategic Considerations

### Domain Strategy
- **Primary:** .com.au is essential for Australian market credibility
- **Secondary:** .com is nice-to-have for brand protection and international expansion
- **Only LevyLite** has both domains available - significant strategic advantage

### Brand Fit with Kokoro Software
- Kokoro means "heart/spirit" in Japanese - suggests care, simplicity, human focus
- Names should feel warm and approachable, not cold/corporate
- Technical competence without intimidation
- **LevyLite** and **LotKeeper** best match this tone

### Differentiation from Competitors
**Competitors:** StrataMax, MRI Strata Master, Urbanise, Intellistrata, Strack, PropertyIQ, MYBOS

**Pattern Analysis:**
- Most use "Strata" prefix (StrataMax, Strata Master) - corporate
- Some use invented words (Urbanise, Strack) - enterprise feel
- MYBOS, PropertyIQ use compound/acronyms - tech/corporate

**Our positioning:** Need to feel accessible, NOT enterprise
- Avoid "Strata" prefix saturation
- Use terms that small operators understand ("lot", "levy")
- Communicate simplicity/lightness ("lite", "simple", "easy")

### Verbal Identity
**Strongest for saying out loud:**
1. LevyLite - "Levy Light" (clever wordplay)
2. LotKeeper - "Lot Keeper" (clear, friendly)
3. SimpleLots - "Simple Lots" (direct)

**Potential issues:**
- LotBase - Could be confused with "lot-based" in conversation
- Blokly - Requires spelling out

---

## 💡 Final Recommendation

**Choose LevyLite** for these reasons:

1. **Domain Availability:** Only candidate with BOTH .com.au AND .com available
2. **Brand Strength:** Wordplay connects directly to strata management (levy) while communicating simplicity/affordability (lite)
3. **Differentiation:** Doesn't follow competitor patterns, stands out in market
4. **Memorability:** Easy to spell, say, remember - passes the "phone test"
5. **Positioning:** Perfectly communicates "$6/lot/month, no minimums" value prop
6. **Tone:** Modern but not try-hard, approachable, Australian-friendly

**Backup options (in order):**
1. LotKeeper - Strong second choice if LevyLite doesn't resonate
2. SimpleLots - Safe, clear choice
3. LotBase - Modern, tech-friendly
4. StrataCore - More conservative option
